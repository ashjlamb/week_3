    <h1>Silicon Chip Implant Marvel</h1>
    <p>
    One of the more remarkable medical developements in the past two decades has
    been the ability to take specialized adult cells and revert 
    them into the kind of non-specialized stem cells found in embryonic tissue. This will allow
    the embryonic tissue to grow into various cells, tissues, and orgrans
    compatible with the patient. The IU team's approach is to forgo the labratory
    and turn the human body into its own cell programmer using a technology
    called nano-trasfection. This uses a silicon nanochip that has been printed
    to include channels ending in an array of micro-needles. On top of the chip
    is a retangular cargo container, which holds specific genes.

    <p>
    The technology has been under developement for over five years, and the IU team
    is now focusing on going beyond prototyping to making the nanochip a practical
    concern that can used in clinical settings. This includes securing US FDA approval
    next year, which would open up the potential for clinical research in people.
    Potential applications in civilian and military medicine include repairing brain
    damage resulting from a stroke or reversing never damage caused by diabetes.

    <h2>Other Areas of Research</h2>
    <p> 
    IU School of Medicine Participating in the Trauma and Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (TAP) Trial
    The leading cause of death under the age of 45 is trauma, caused by bleeding. Kcentra® (or 4-factor
    Prothrombin Concentrate) is a FDA approved product that contains clotting factors. It does the 
    opposite of certain medications given to "thin" the blood in patients when they are to undergo
    surgery. There has been evidence that Kcentra® may reduce the chance of dying in injured patients
    who are not on blood-thinning medications.
